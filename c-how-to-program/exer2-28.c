//  distinguish between the terms fatal error and nonfatal error. why might you prefer to experience
// a fatal error rather than a nonfatal error?

/* a fatal error is an error that causes a program immediately terminates
without performing its job; a nonfatal error not. I prefer nonfatal errors
because they allow the completion of a program, even though they often
produce incorrect results. */
