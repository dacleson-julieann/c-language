// example 1: C Output

#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
  //display the string inside quotations
  printf("C Programming!!");
  return 0;
}

/*
how does this program work?
- all valid c program must contain main() funtion. the code execution
begins from the start of the main() function.
- the printf() is a library function to send formatted output to the screen.
the function pritnts the string inside quotations
- to use printf() in our program, we need to include stdio.h header file
using #include <stdio.h> statement.
- the return 0; statement inside the main() function is the "Exit status" of
the program. It's optional.
